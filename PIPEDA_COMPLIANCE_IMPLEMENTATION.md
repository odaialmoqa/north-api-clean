## Usage Examples

### Recording User Consent
```kotlin
val consent = ConsentRecord(
    id = "consent_1",
    userId = "user_123",
    purpose = ConsentPurpose.ACCOUNT_AGGREGATION,
    granted = true,
    timestamp = Clock.System.now(),
    ipAddress = "192.168.1.1",
    userAgent = "NorthApp/1.0",
    version = "2025.1.0"
)

val result = consentManager.recordConsent(consent)
```

### Requesting Data Export
```kotlin
val exportResult = dataExportManager.requestDataExport(
    userId = "user_123",
    format = ExportFormat.JSON
)

if (exportResult is DataExportResult.Success) {
    val exportId = exportResult.exportId
    // Monitor export status and provide download when ready
}
```

### Requesting Data Deletion
```kotlin
val deletionResult = dataDeletionManager.requestAccountDeletion(
    userId = "user_123",
    reason = DeletionReason.USER_REQUEST
)

if (deletionResult is DeletionResult.Success) {
    val gracePeriodEnds = deletionResult.gracePeriodEnds
    // User can cancel deletion until grace period ends
}
```

### Audit Logging
```kotlin
auditLogger.logDataAccess(DataAccessEvent(
    userId = "user_123",
    dataType = "financial_data",
    resourceId = "account_456",
    accessMethod = AccessMethod.API,
    purpose = "dashboard_display",
    ipAddress = "192.168.1.1",
    userAgent = "NorthApp/1.0",
    sessionId = "session_789"
))
```

## Compliance Verification

The implementation includes comprehensive compliance verification through:

1. **Audit Reports** - Automated generation of compliance reports
2. **Data Verification** - Verification that deleted data is actually removed
3. **Consent Tracking** - Complete audit trail of consent decisions
4. **Risk Assessment** - Automated risk scoring of data operations
5. **Compliance Metrics** - Key performance indicators for privacy compliance

## Next Steps

1. **UI Integration** - Implement user-facing privacy controls in the mobile app
2. **Automated Scheduling** - Set up background jobs for data deletion processing
3. **Compliance Monitoring** - Implement real-time compliance monitoring dashboards
4. **Privacy Policy Integration** - Connect with dynamic privacy policy management
5. **Third-party Integration** - Ensure compliance extends to all integrated services

This implementation provides a solid foundation for PIPEDA compliance and can be extended to meet additional privacy regulations as needed.
