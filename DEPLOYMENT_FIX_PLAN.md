# North Mobile App - Deployment Fix Plan

## Current Issues

### 1. Missing ADB Command
- **Issue**: `adb: command not found`
- **Solution**: Install Android platform tools
- **Command**: `brew install android-platform-tools`

### 2. Massive Compilation Errors
The build is failing with hundreds of compilation errors including:
- Missing dependencies (Firebase, Plaid SDK)
- Unresolved references throughout the codebase
- Type mismatches and syntax errors
- Missing imports and dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

Since the current codebase has extensive compilation issues, I recommend creating a **minimal working version** for deployment testing:

### Option A: Fix Current Codebase (Time-intensive)
- Fix all 500+ compilation errors
- Add missing dependencies
- Resolve type conflicts
- This could take several hours

### Option B: Create Minimal Demo App (Recommended)
- Create a simplified version with core UI
- Focus on getting something deployable to your Pixel 9 Pro
- Add features incrementally once basic deployment works

## Recommended Approach

Let's create a minimal working Android app that you can deploy and test on your Pixel 9 Pro, then build up from there.

### Minimal App Features:
1. **Basic UI**: Simple dashboard with mock data
2. **Navigation**: Basic screen navigation
3. **Material Design**: Proper Android theming
4. **No External Dependencies**: Avoid Firebase, Plaid, etc. initially

This approach will:
- Get you testing on your device quickly
- Establish a working deployment pipeline
- Allow incremental feature addition
- Avoid debugging hundreds of compilation errors

## Next Steps

1. Install ADB: `brew install android-platform-tools`
2. Create minimal working app
3. Deploy to Pixel 9 Pro
4. Verify deployment pipeline works
5. Incrementally add features

Would you like me to proceed with creating the minimal working version?
