# Mobile App Testing Guide - Plaid Link Fix

## 🎯 What We Fixed

The mobile app was getting stuck on "Connecting..." after completing the Plaid Link flow. We've implemented a proper callback mechanism to resolve this issue.

## 📱 Testing the Fix

### Prerequisites
- ✅ Mobile app built and deployed to Android device
- ✅ Backend server running (for token exchange)
- ✅ Plaid sandbox credentials configured

### Test Steps

#### 1. Launch the App
- Open the North app on your Android device
- Navigate to the dashboard

#### 2. Test Plaid Link Flow
- Tap "Connect Bank Account" button
- **Expected**: Plaid Link UI should open

#### 3. Complete Bank Connection
- Select a test bank (e.g., "First Platypus Bank")
- Enter test credentials (username: `user_good`, password: `pass_good`)
- Complete the connection flow
- **Expected**: Plaid UI should close and return to the app

#### 4. Verify Fix
- **BEFORE FIX**: App would be stuck on "Connecting..." indefinitely ❌
- **AFTER FIX**: App should show "Connected" state within seconds ✅

### 🔍 Debugging

#### View App Logs
```bash
adb logcat | grep "NorthApp"
```

#### Key Log Messages to Look For
```
✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS:
🔧 DEBUG: Starting Plaid Link launch...
🔧 DEBUG: Plaid Link opened successfully!
🔧 MainActivity.onActivityResult called: requestCode=1001, resultCode=-1
✅ Plaid Link successful! Calling PlaidCallbackManager...
🎉 PlaidCallbackManager.handleSuccess called with token: public-sandbox-...
🎉 SUCCESS CALLBACK RECEIVED in PlaidLinkComponent!

❌ ERROR INDICATORS:
❌ Activity context is null!
❌ Failed to open Plaid Link
❌ Plaid Link error: [error message]
❌ PlaidCallbackManager.handleError called: [error]
```

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: App still stuck on "Connecting..."
- **Check**: Are you seeing the PlaidCallbackManager success logs?
- **Solution**: Verify MainActivity.onActivityResult is being called

**Issue**: Plaid Link doesn't open
- **Check**: Look for "Activity context is null" errors
- **Solution**: Ensure proper context is being passed

**Issue**: No logs appearing
- **Check**: Is the device properly connected?
- **Solution**: Run `adb devices` to verify connection

### 🧪 Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Successful Connection
1. Tap "Connect Bank Account"
2. Select "First Platypus Bank"
3. Use credentials: `user_good` / `pass_good`
4. Complete flow
5. **Expected**: App shows "Connected" state

#### Scenario 2: User Cancellation
1. Tap "Connect Bank Account"
2. Tap "Cancel" or back button in Plaid UI
3. **Expected**: App returns to original state with error message

#### Scenario 3: Connection Error
1. Tap "Connect Bank Account"
2. Select "First Platypus Bank"
3. Use invalid credentials: `user_bad` / `pass_bad`
4. **Expected**: App shows appropriate error message

### 📊 Success Criteria

- ✅ Plaid Link UI opens successfully
- ✅ User can complete bank connection
- ✅ App transitions from "Connecting..." to "Connected"
- ✅ No indefinite loading states
- ✅ Proper error handling for cancellation/failures
