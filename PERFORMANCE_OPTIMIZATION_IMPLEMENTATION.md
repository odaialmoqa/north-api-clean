- Intelligent sync scheduling based on battery level and charging status
- WiFi-only sync options to reduce cellular data usage
- Adaptive sync frequency based on data change patterns
- Configurable battery thresholds for sync pausing
- Priority-based sync task management

**Sync Optimization Strategies:**
- Reduced sync frequency during battery optimization mode

- Automatic sync pausing on low battery (<20% by default)

**Configuration Options:**
- Enable/disable battery optimization
- Sync only when charging option
- WiFi-only sync requirement
- Low battery threshold configuration
- Maximum concurrent sync tasks limit
- Adaptive sync frequency adjustment

### ✅ Comprehensive Testing
