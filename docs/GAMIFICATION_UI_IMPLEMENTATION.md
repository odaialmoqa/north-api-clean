## Design Principles

### Visual Design
- **Clean and Modern**: Minimalist interface with plenty of white space
- **Calming Colors**: Deep blues, soft greens, warm grays
- **Consistent Iconography**: Rounded, friendly shapes with emoji support
- **Subtle Animations**: Provide feedback without distraction

### User Experience
- **Immediate Feedback**: All actions trigger instant visual response
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex information revealed gradually
- **Accessibility First**: Screen reader support and high contrast modes
- **Anxiety Reduction**: Non-intimidating presentations of financial data

### Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient rendering of large lists
- **Animation Optimization**: 60 FPS target with proper cleanup
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of animation resources
- **Battery Efficiency**: Minimal background processing

## Technical Implementation

### Animation Framework
- **Compose Animation API**: Leverages Jetpack Compose's animation system
- **Spring Physics**: Natural feeling animations with proper damping
- **Easing Functions**: FastOutSlowIn for smooth transitions
