# AI Personal CFO Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

The North mobile app needs to transform from a traditional financial management app into an AI-driven personal CFO experience. The core concept is that users interact primarily through conversation with their AI financial coach, which learns about them and automatically creates personalized financial goals and recommendations. This requires integrating Plaid for bank account connections, enhancing the AI chat experience, adding proper account management, and implementing logout functionality.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily connect my bank accounts through a secure and trusted service, so that my personal CFO can analyze my transactions and provide personalized financial advice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user taps "Connect Bank Account" THEN the Plaid Link flow SHALL be initiated with proper branding and security messaging
3. WHEN a user successfully connects an account THEN it SHALL appear in their accounts list with real balance and transaction data
4. WHEN account connection fails THEN appropriate error messaging SHALL be displayed with retry options

7. WHEN users want to modify goals THEN they SHALL do so through conversation rather than forms

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Account Management System

### Requirement 5: AI CFO Integration with Financial Data
