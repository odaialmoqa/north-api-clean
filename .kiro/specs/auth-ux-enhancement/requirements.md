# Authentication UX Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical user experience improvements for the North mobile app's authentication system. The current authentication flow works functionally but lacks several key UX features that create friction for users, including poor logo design, lack of session persistence, inadequate keyboard handling, missing text input enhancements, and no password recovery options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Logo Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user opening the North app, I want to see a polished, professional logo that represents the brand well, so that I have confidence in the app's quality and professionalism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication screen loads THEN the logo SHALL display as a visually appealing North star/diamond with proper proportions and depth
2. WHEN viewing the logo THEN it SHALL have a gradient background with appropriate contrast and visual hierarchy
3. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN it SHALL match the design consistency found in other parts of the app
4. WHEN the logo renders THEN it SHALL be crisp and clear at the 64dp size without pixelation or distortion

### Requirement 2: Session Persistence and Authentication State Management

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to stay logged in between app sessions, so that I don't have to repeatedly enter my credentials every time I open the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the app SHALL securely store the authentication token
2. WHEN the app is reopened THEN the system SHALL check for a valid stored authentication token
3. IF a valid token exists THEN the app SHALL automatically navigate to the dashboard without requiring re-authentication
4. WHEN the stored token expires or becomes invalid THEN the app SHALL gracefully redirect to the authentication screen
5. WHEN a user explicitly logs out THEN the app SHALL clear all stored authentication data
6. WHEN authentication data is stored THEN it SHALL use secure storage mechanisms appropriate for the platform

### Requirement 3: Text Input Capitalization Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user entering my name during registration, I want the first letter of my first and last name to be automatically capitalized, so that I don't have to manually adjust capitalization and my name appears properly formatted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the "First Name" field THEN the first letter SHALL be automatically capitalized
2. WHEN a user types in the "Last Name" field THEN the first letter SHALL be automatically capitalized
3. WHEN a user types multiple words in name fields THEN each word's first letter SHALL be capitalized (title case)
4. WHEN capitalization is applied THEN it SHALL not interfere with the user's ability to override if needed
5. WHEN the user backspaces to the beginning of a name field THEN the next character typed SHALL be capitalized

### Requirement 4: Keyboard-Aware Form Layout

**User Story:** As a user filling out the registration form on a mobile device, I want all form fields to remain visible and accessible when the keyboard appears, so that I can easily navigate between fields and see what I'm typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the keyboard appears THEN all form fields SHALL remain visible and accessible
2. WHEN a user taps on a form field that would be obscured by the keyboard THEN the form SHALL automatically scroll to keep that field visible
3. WHEN the keyboard is visible THEN the form layout SHALL adjust to provide optimal spacing and visibility
4. WHEN navigating between fields using keyboard actions (Next/Done) THEN the focus SHALL move smoothly without fields being hidden
5. WHEN the keyboard dismisses THEN the form layout SHALL return to its original state
6. WHEN the form is scrollable due to keyboard presence THEN scroll indicators SHALL be visible if needed

### Requirement 5: Forgot Password Functionality

**User Story:** As a user who has forgotten my password, I want to be able to reset it through a secure process, so that I can regain access to my account without creating a new one.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the login form THEN there SHALL be a "Forgot Password?" link or button
2. WHEN a user taps "Forgot Password?" THEN they SHALL be presented with a password reset form
3. WHEN a user enters their email for password reset THEN the system SHALL send a reset link to that email address
4. WHEN a password reset is requested THEN the user SHALL receive clear feedback about the next steps
5. WHEN an invalid email is entered for reset THEN appropriate error messaging SHALL be displayed
6. WHEN a user clicks a password reset link THEN they SHALL be able to set a new password securely
7. WHEN password reset is completed THEN the user SHALL be able to log in with their new password
8. WHEN a password reset link expires THEN the user SHALL be informed and able to request a new one
