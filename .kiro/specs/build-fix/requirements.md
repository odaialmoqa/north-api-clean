# Build Fix Requirements Document

## Introduction

The North Mobile App currently has compilation errors preventing successful build and deployment to test devices. The authentication flow has been fixed to show the login screen first, but build errors in the shared module are blocking testing. This spec addresses fixing the critical build issues to enable immediate testing of the authentication functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to build successfully, so that I can deploy it to my phone and test the authentication flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command is executed THEN the app SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN the app is deployed to a device THEN it SHALL launch successfully
3. WHEN the app launches THEN it SHALL show the authentication screen first
4. IF there are non-critical compilation errors THEN they SHALL be temporarily disabled or commented out
5. WHEN the authentication flow is tested THEN it SHALL connect to the Railway API successfully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to isolate critical build errors from non-critical ones, so that I can prioritize fixes that enable immediate testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing build errors THEN critical errors that prevent compilation SHALL be identified
2. WHEN non-critical features cause build errors THEN they SHALL be temporarily disabled
3. WHEN the core authentication and UI functionality is preserved THEN the app SHALL remain functional for testing
4. IF database or sync features have errors THEN they SHALL be stubbed out temporarily
5. WHEN the build succeeds THEN only essential features for authentication testing SHALL be active

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the fastest path to a working build, so that I can test the authentication fix immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing build errors THEN the minimal necessary changes SHALL be made
2. WHEN disabling problematic code THEN it SHALL be clearly marked for future restoration
3. WHEN the app builds successfully THEN it SHALL retain the authentication screen as the starting point
4. IF complex features cause build failures THEN they SHALL be temporarily removed from the build
5. WHEN the authentication works THEN the build fix SHALL be considered successful
