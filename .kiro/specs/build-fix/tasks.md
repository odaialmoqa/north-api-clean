# Build Fix Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze and categorize build errors
  - Review the compilation error log to identify specific failing components
  - Separate critical authentication-related errors from non-critical feature errors
  - Create a priority list of errors that must be fixed vs. can be disabled
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Fix or disable problematic repository implementations
  - Comment out or stub complex repository methods causing compilation errors
  - Replace database-dependent code with simple in-memory implementations
  - Ensure AuthRepository remains functional for authentication testing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3, 3.1_

- [x] 3. Disable sync service components
  - Comment out or disable sync-related services causing compilation errors
  - Remove sync service dependencies from dependency injection if needed
  - Stub out sync interfaces to prevent compilation failures
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Fix domain model compilation issues
  - Resolve Currency and Money class redeclaration errors
  - Fix enum definition issues in domain models
  - Ensure core models needed for authentication remain working
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3, 3.1_

- [ ] 5. Disable problematic database operations
  - Comment out SQLDelight-related code causing compilation errors
  - Stub out database driver factories if they cause issues
  - Replace database queries with simple mock implementations
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Fix dependency injection issues
  - Remove or comment out problematic module dependencies
  - Ensure core authentication dependencies remain available
  - Stub out complex service dependencies
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3, 3.1_

- [x] 7. Test build and deployment
  - Run the build command to verify compilation succeeds
  - Deploy the app to the test device
  - Verify the app launches and shows authentication screen
  - Test basic authentication flow with Railway API
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5_

- [ ] 8. Document temporary changes
  - Add clear TODO comments for all disabled code
  - Create a list of components that need to be re-enabled later
  - Ensure the authentication fix is preserved and working
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.2, 3.3_
