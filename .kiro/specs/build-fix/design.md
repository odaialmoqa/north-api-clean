# Build Fix Design Document

## Overview

This design focuses on the fastest path to resolve compilation errors blocking app deployment. The strategy is to temporarily disable or stub out problematic components while preserving the core authentication functionality that needs testing.

## Architecture

### Build Error Categories
1. **Critical Errors**: Prevent compilation entirely
2. **Feature Errors**: Related to complex features not needed for auth testing
3. **Dependency Errors**: Missing imports or unresolved references

### Fix Strategy
1. **Immediate**: Comment out or disable problematic code
2. **Stub**: Replace complex implementations with simple stubs
3. **Isolate**: Separate working code from broken code

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Components (Must Work)
- MainActivity and navigation
- AuthScreen and authentication flow
- AuthRepository and API communication
- Basic UI components and theme

### Non-Critical Components (Can Be Disabled)
- Sync services and complex data synchronization
- Advanced repository implementations
- Gamification features
- Complex database operations
- Performance optimization features

### Stubbing Strategy
- Replace complex repository implementations with simple in-memory versions
- Stub out database operations that cause compilation errors
- Disable sync services temporarily
- Comment out problematic imports and dependencies

## Data Models

### Keep Working
- Basic User model
- Authentication models
- API response models

### Stub or Disable
- Complex database models
- Sync-related models
- Gamification models with compilation issues

## Error Handling

### Build Error Resolution
1. Identify the root cause of each compilation error
2. Determine if the error is in critical or non-critical code
3. Apply the appropriate fix strategy (disable, stub, or fix)
4. Verify the build succeeds after each change

### Temporary Fixes
- Use `// TODO: Re-enable after build fix` comments
- Create simple stub implementations
- Disable entire modules if necessary

## Testing Strategy

### Build Verification
1. Run build command after each fix
2. Verify app launches on device
3. Test authentication screen appears
4. Test basic authentication flow

### Rollback Plan
- Keep track of all temporary changes
- Document what was disabled for future restoration
- Ensure no permanent damage to working code
