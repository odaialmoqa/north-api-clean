# Backend Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. Added Plaid Debug Endpoint
- Added `/debug/plaid` endpoint to help diagnose Plaid configuration issues
- Shows detailed information about environment variables and Plaid client status

### 2. Issue Identified
The backend has a critical issue where it exits the process if Plaid credentials are missing in production mode:

```javascript
if (!PLAID_CLIENT_ID || !PLAID_SECRET) {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    console.error('‚ùå Missing required Plaid configuration...');
    process.exit(1); // THIS KILLS THE SERVER!
  }
}
```

## üîß What Needs to be Done

### Push Changes to Railway
1. Commit the current changes (the debug endpoint has been added)
2. Push to your Railway-connected repository
3. Railway will automatically redeploy

### Test the Fix
After Railway redeploys, test:
```bash
curl https://north-api-clean-production.up.railway.app/debug/plaid
```

This will show if the Plaid environment variables are properly loaded.

## üéØ Expected Result

Once the debug endpoint is deployed, we can:
1. See exactly what environment variables the backend is receiving
2. Identify if the server is crashing on startup due to missing credentials
3. Fix the specific configuration issue

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Push to Railway**: Commit and push the current changes
2. **Test Debug Endpoint**: Check `/debug/plaid` to see Plaid config
3. **Fix Root Cause**: Based on debug info, fix the environment variable issue
4. **Test Mobile App**: Once backend is fixed, mobile app should work

The mobile app code is already correct - the issue is purely on the backend side with environment variable loading or server startup.
